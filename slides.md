# Intro to Machine Learning Model Deployments

Once a machine learning model has been trained, it needs to be deployed so that it can be used to make predictions on new data. This is where machine learning model deployment comes in.

Model deployment is an important step in the machine learning lifecycle because it's how you turn a trained model into a working application. The goal of model deployment is to make it easy for others to use the model, whether it's through an API, a web application, or a mobile app.

# Why is this necessary

There are several reasons why model deployment is important:

1. **It enables the model to be used by others:** Without model deployment, a trained model is just a set of code that's sitting on a computer somewhere. Deployment makes it possible for others to use the model to make predictions or decisions.

2. **It allows the model to be updated and improved:** Machine learning models need to be updated and improved over time as new data becomes available or the problem they're solving changes. Deployment makes it easy to update and improve the model without disrupting its use.

# Few Basic ways how we can do this

**1. Web applications:** One way to deploy a machine learning model is by integrating it into a web application. This can be done using programming languages like Python, which has popular web frameworks like Django and Flask that make it easy to build and deploy web applications that use machine learning models.

**2. APIs:** Another way to deploy a machine learning model is by creating an API (Application Programming Interface). An API is a set of rules that define how software applications can interact with each other. By creating an API for your machine learning model, you can make it easy for other applications to use the model's predictions.
